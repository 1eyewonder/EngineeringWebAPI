Created a very basic web API for ASME maximum allowable stress tables. 
I wanted to do this since I know many places rely on excel tables and thought this was a more effective solution.
A similar working model, not a web API though, can be found here: https://www.cis-inspector.com/asme-code-allowable-stresses-table-1a.htm
